# Begemed 

This project is written in `C++` using `WinAPI`. This is simple game of moving gems (tiles). There are three diffrernt board sizes available, you can switch them using `1`,`2`,`3` keys.
<br>
You can start game pressing `F2`, it will color the board in 6 different colors. Over the main window there is placed screen-size overlaying transparent (as color and for events) window with small text label.
As was required in the task, I used double-buffering for GDI. 
<br>
Those are all files needed to compile and run project.
